Here is an explanation of what each test does and how it validates the underlying logic.

### `TestEGModel` - Validating the Data Structures

This class ensures that the foundational building blocks of our graph in `eg_model.py` are sound.

* **`test_context_nesting`**:
    * **What it does:** It creates a graph with cuts nested three levels deep: `( ( () ) )`.
    * **How it validates:** It checks that the `get_nesting_level()` method returns the correct depth (0, 1, and 2). [cite_start]This confirms that the parent-child tree structure of contexts is built correctly, which is essential for the positive/negative context checks used by the inference rules[cite: 1450, 1625].

* **`test_ligature_creation_and_merge`**:
    * **What it does:** It uses the `EGEditor.connect` method to simulate drawing lines between predicate hooks, first creating a simple ligature and then forcing it to merge with another.
    * **How it validates:** It confirms that the `connect` logic correctly creates and, crucially, merges `Ligature` objects. [cite_start]This ensures that when multiple lines are joined in the drawing, they are correctly represented as a single object in the data model, which is the core of Peirce's concept of a "line of identity" [cite: 3894-3896].

* **`test_ligature_starting_context` & `test_ligature_starting_context_lca`**:
    * **What they do:** These tests create ligatures that span across different contexts (e.g., from the Sheet of Assertion into a cut, or between two sibling cuts).
    * **How it validates:** They test the most critical part of the `Ligature` model: its ability to determine its correct quantificational scope. The tests assert that `get_starting_context()` correctly finds the **Least Common Ancestor (LCA)** of all its connection points. [cite_start]This validates that a line connecting predicates in different areas is correctly understood to be quantified in the shared outer area that contains them both, which is essential for correct translation to CLIF [cite: 4399-4400, 2452].

### `TestTransformations` - Validating the Rules of Inference

This class tests the `Validator` and the transformation methods in `EGEditor`, ensuring they adhere to the formal rules of the calculus.

* **`test_can_insert_and_erase`**:
    * **What it does:** Creates predicates in contexts at even (positive) and odd (negative) nesting levels.
    * **How it validates:** It asserts that `validator.can_insert` returns `True` only for the negative context and `validator.can_erase` returns `True` only for the positive ones. [cite_start]This directly verifies our implementation of the fundamental rules of erasure and insertion as described by Dau [cite: 256, 257, 1741-1745].

* **`test_deiteration`**:
    * **What it does:** It creates the graph `(P(P))`, which represents an iterated copy of `P` inside the original `P`'s cut.
    * **How it validates:** It performs two crucial checks. First, it asserts that `validator.can_deiterate` correctly identifies the *inner* `P` as a valid copy to be erased, but correctly identifies the *outer* `P` as the original, which cannot be de-iterated. Second, it calls `editor.deiterate` and asserts that the resulting graph state is `(P())` by checking its CLIF translation. This validates the entire de-iteration workflow from check to execution.

### `TestClifTranslator` - Validating the End-to-End Translation

This class ensures that complete, well-formed graphs are translated into the correct final CLIF strings.

* **`test_empty_graph`, `test_simple_negation`, `test_simple_implication`**:
    * **What they do:** Build the simplest "Alpha" graphs for propositional logic.
    * **How it validates:** They confirm that the translator handles the most basic logical structures correctly: `true`, `(not P)`, and `(P -> Q)`.

* **`test_quantified_conjunction`**:
    * **What it does:** Builds the "cat is on a mat" graph, which has two separate ligatures on the Sheet of Assertion.
    * **How it validates:** It confirms that two ligatures existing at the same level translate into two distinct variables (`x1`, `x2`) bound by the same `exists` quantifier. It also confirms that our deterministic sorting works, producing a predictable and correct output string every time.

* **`test_universal_quantifier`**:
    * **What it does:** Builds the graph for "Every cat is an animal," `((cat-)(animal-))`. This is the most complex structure, involving a ligature that starts in an outer cut and connects predicates in two different inner cuts.
    * **How it validates:** This test is the ultimate check of our scope-finding and translation logic. It verifies that the `get_starting_context` LCA logic works correctly, causing the `ClifTranslator` to place the `(exists x1)` quantifier at the correct level (inside the first `not` but outside the `and`), correctly forming the universal quantifier pattern `(not (exists ... (not ...)))`.

This suite of tests provides high confidence that the core logic of your application is a faithful and robust implementation of the system described in the source documents.
